1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and
parentheses?

ANSWER: Square brakets makes it a list comprehension which returns the final list with all elements whereas a parentheses creates a generator object which generates elements on the go.

2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?

ANSWER:An iterator is any sequence which can be iterated over a for loop. A sequenced object can be made into an iterator by passing it through the iter() function. The next() function returns subsequent elements of an iterator in every run.
       Conversely, a generator is a function that uses the yield keyword instead of the return keyword to return multiple values when called. unlike a regular function, a generator doesnot return the entire sequence in one go, but returns each element one by one everey time it is called.
       All generators are iterators by default, but all iterators are not generators.

3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?

ANSWER:On calling a generator function, it will return a generator object and not actual values. Also, if we look at the function definition, a generator will have the yield keyword instead of 'return'.

4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?

ANSWER:yield statement allows a function to return multiple values instead of just one. It converts a function into a generator.

5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and
contrast between the two.

ANSWER:Both are used to transform the elements of agiven sequence into other. however the syntaxes are different: map() is a function that takes two argument, the transformation functin and the sequence, while list is a concise single line loop statement with an optional conditional statement.
